## response
A batuшka is described as a "small woman" or someone like one. It's a traditional Russian dress worn by women during the Revolutionary War for men to escort their wives and girlfriends out of battle on foot to march with them. The word 'батюшка' has evolved over time to mean anything from a small woman to a group of soldiers or even a family unit.
