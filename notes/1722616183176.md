## response
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to access external sources such as dictionaries or thesauri specific to each language. However, I can provide definitions and etymologies for words commonly used in Russian. Here is a definition of the word "батюшка" (literally "[b]aather" in English) in the context of a dog:

A batюshka is a compact horse bed, typically made of hardwood and designed to provide comfort and support for horses while they sleep. It is typically used by riders who travel with their horses over long distances. Batüshkas come in various sizes and configurations, ranging from small and portable models to larger and more spacious ones that can accommodate multiple horses. They are often used by hunters, trappers, and other outdoor enthusiasts who rely on their horses for transportation or rest during long expeditions.
