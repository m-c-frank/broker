## response
According to Google Translate "batuyushka" is indeed a real word, as it means "bride" or "wife." However, let me expand on the meaning and nuances of this term in Russian.

A batuyschka is also called a masha for a wife, daughter, or sister-in-law. When referring to them as such, one must properly address the masha using the appropriate titles — Masha/Komissarina/Komissarova/Komissarian in male and female gender roles, respectively. Additionally, a batuyschka has the right to own her or his property and make laws for her or him, and can even dissolve their marriage if they wish. Importantly, the Russian title for a batuyschka is not a surname like "batuyshev" is in English, but just "batuyschka".
