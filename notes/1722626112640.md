A batюshka is an old-fashioned dress worn by women in Russia, typically around their waist. It is traditionally made from wool and is lined with silk, creating a soft and fluffy appearance. The term "batюshka" comes from the Slavic word "бутышка", which means "dress".

The batюshka has been worn as part of traditional dress for centuries, with the iconic silhouette of a woman's skirt and flared bodice symbolizing femininity, freedom, and rebellion. The style has also become associated with masculinity and is often seen as a symbol of Russian strength and independence.

The batюshka may be dyed or patterned throughout history, with different regions and time periods developing their own distinctive styles. In more recent times, the batюshka has been embraced by fashion designers worldwide and remains an iconic symbol of Russian culture today.
