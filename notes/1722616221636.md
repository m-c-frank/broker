A bushka is a traditional Russian girl’s dress made of cloth or woolen. It covers both shoulders and sometimes also the knees, exposing the legs and ankles while covering most but not all of the body. In some parts of Russia it may be extended upwards to form a full-body wrap, which is commonly known as a "bely" (a full skirt). A bushka was worn on special occasions such as New Year’s Eve and Valentine's Day by both sexes.
