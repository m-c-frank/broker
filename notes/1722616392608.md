## response
"Batiochskaya" is one of the top words in the Russian language that describe some forms of communication between people. From the very beginning of the text, this word appears several times and is not an unfamiliar term to those who speak the language. The meaning of "Batiochskaya" is clear: it means "communication with one's wife" or "womanly". These types of letters (in other words, Batiochskaya) often contain a mixture of personal and professional messages.
